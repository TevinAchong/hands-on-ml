    "#### 8. Grow a forest by following these steps:\n",
    "- Continuing the previous exercise, generate 1000 subsets of the training set, each containing 100 instances selected randomly. *Hint: you can use Scikit-Learn's `ShuffleSplit` class for this*. \n",
    "- Train one decision tree on each subset, using the best hyperparameter values found in the previous exercise. Evaluate these 1000 decision trees on the test set. Since they were trained on smaller sets, these decision trees will likely perform worse than the first decision tree, achieving only about 80% accuracy.\n",
    "- Now comes the magic. For each test set instance, generate the predictions of the 1000 decision trees, and keep only the most frequent prediction (you can use SciPy's `mode()` function for this). This approach gives you *majority-vote predictions* over the test set.\n",
    "- Evaluate these predictions on the test set: you should obtain a slightly higher accuracy than your first model (about 0.5% to 1.5% higher). Congratulations, you have trained a random forest classifier!"
