    "#### 7. Train and fine-tune a decision tree for the moons dataset by following these steps:\n",
    "- Use `make_moons(n_samples=10000, noise=0.4)` to generate a moons dataset.\n",
    "- Use `train_test_split()` to split the dataset into a training set and a test set.\n",
    "- Use grid search with cross-validation (with the help of the `GridSearchCV` class) to find good hyperparameter values for a `DecisionTreeClassifier`. Hint: try various values for `max_leaf_nodes`.\n",
    "- Train it on the full training set using these hyperparameters, and measure your model's performance on the test set. You should get roughly 85% to 87% accuracy. "

Since they were trained on smaller sets, these decision trees will likely perform worse than the first decision tree, achieving only about 80% accuracy.\n",
