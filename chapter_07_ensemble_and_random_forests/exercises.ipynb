    "- Yes you can definitely combine these models to get better results. This is because ensemble methods work best when the predictors are diverse (i.e. using different algorithms); this means they will make very different types of errors. E.g. we can take the predictions of a SVC, a RandomForest, and a LogisticRegressor, aggregate these predictions (take the most common prediction, or the most likely) and use this as the final prediction.\n",

    "- If you have trained five different models and they all achieve 95% precision, you can try combining them into a voting ensemble, which will often give you even better results. It works better if the models are very different (e.g., an SVM classifier, a Decision Tree classifier, a Logistic Regression classifier and so on). It is even better if they are trained on different training instances (that's the whole point of bagging and pasting ensembles), but if not this will still be effective as long as the models are very different.\n"

    "- A hard voting classifier just counts the votes of each classifier in the ensemble and picks the class that gets the most votes. A soft voting classifier computes the average estimated class probability for each class and picks the class with the highest probability. This gives high-confidence votes more weight and often performs better, but it only works if every classifier is able to estimate class probabilities (e.g. for the SVM classifiers in Scikit-Learn, you must set `probability=True`)"
