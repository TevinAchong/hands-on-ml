    "### 10. Train an SVM classifier on the wine dataset, which you can load using `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()`. This dataset contains the chemical analyses of 178 wine samples produced by 3 different cultivators: the goal is to train a classification model capable of predicting the cultivator based on the wine's chemical analysis. Since SVM classifiers are binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all three classes. What accuracy can you reach?"
