    "### 11. Train and fine-tune an SVM regressor on the California housing dataset. You can use the original dataset rather than the tweaked version we used in Chapter 2, which you can load using `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()`. The targets represent hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since there are over 20,000 instances, SVMs can be slow, so for hyperparameter tuning you should use far fewer instances (e.g. 2000) to test many more hyperparameter combinations. What is your best model's RMSE?"
